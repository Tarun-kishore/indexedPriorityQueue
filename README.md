# indexedPriorityQueue
Priority queue is a data structure in which data is stored on basis of its priority. In an Indexed Priority Queue, data is stored just like standard priority queue and along with this, the value of a data can be updated using its key. It is called “indexed” because  a hash map can be used to store the index in container using the key of key-value pair input  as the key of hash map. This comes handy while implementing  Dijkstra’s Algorithm using min-heap. It can also be used in any other program where it is required to put key-value pairs in priority queue and along with it you need to update value of keys with push or pop function .

This repository contains the code of implementation of Indexed Priority queue implementation.
